CHECKOUT THE BRANCH BEFORE COPY THE HOMEWORK TO SUBMIT
=======

TAKE OUT A FUCKING PIECE OF PAPER AND WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN



>>>>>>> debug


Progress: 
  I don't know if FAA.v works, in fact, all the files are possibly deprecated, since there were no test data

  MAC_4bit.v: less error right now -> check from the source again


environment:
  from the command line: 
    run "vlib work" to set up the environment for modelsim to work
    , a "work" dir would be created if the execution succeeded


technique:


should we use "And" gate instead? : https://hom-wang.gitbooks.io/verilog-hdl/content/Chapter_03.html

print in verilog: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33653121/using-display-in-verilog

module A(a,b,c);
  input  a,b;
  output c;

  assign c = a&b;

  always @*
    $display("%b",c);
endmodule

or

// inside the module
always @* begin
  $display("%b",c);
end

or, after each stimulus step

initial begin
  #0 a=1'b0;b=1'b0;         
  #1 $display("%b",c);

  #3 a=1'b0;b=1'b0; 
  #1 $display("%b",c);

  #3 a=1'b0;b=1'b0; 
  #1 $display("%b",c);
end
